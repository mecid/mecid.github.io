One of the many things included in SwiftUI Release 3 was the ability to display badges. SwiftUI Release 3 provides you with the *badge* view modifier that we can use to generate badges in lists and tabs. This week we will learn how to use the *badge* view modifier and customize the look and feel of badges.

#### Basics
The *badge* view modifier is available only for iOS and macOS. You can use the *badge* view modifier to generate and display a badge for your view. Keep in mind that only lists and tabs can display badges at the moment. Let's start with a simple example of the *badge* view modifier usage.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Text("Group 1")
                .badge(12)

            Text("Group 2")
                .badge(20)
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we use the *badge* view modifier on the *Text* view, which is a list item. A list displays the badge on the trailing part of the list item. The *badge* view modifier also looks great with sidebar styled lists.

The *badge* view modifier has a few different options. In the previous example, we used the *badge* view modifier with an integer value. SwiftUI uses the environment to format an integer value in an appropriate locale automatically. SwiftUI also hides the badge whenever the integer value is zero.

There is also an opportunity to use another version of the *badge* view modifier to display a string or localized string key instead of an integer value.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Text("Hello World")
                .tabItem {
                    Text("Favorites")
                    Image(systemName: "star")
                }
                .badge(10)
        }
    }
}
```

Remember that you can use the *badge* view modifier with tabs, and that's why you should keep the content of a badge as short as possible. The *badge* view modifier is one of the many inert view modifiers that SwiftUI provides us, which means you can pass the *nil* as the value to hide the badge.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let count: Int
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Text("Hello World")
                .tabItem {
                    Text("Favorites")
                    Image(systemName: "star")
                }
                .badge(count > 0 ? "\(count) stars" : nil)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Customization
Another version of the *badge* view modifier allows us to pass an instance of the *Text* view instead of integer or string values. This fantastic opportunity creates tons of customization options available while displaying badges in SwiftUI.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Text("Group 1")
                .badge(12)

            Text("Group 2")
                .badge(20)
                
            Text("Group 3")
                .badge(
                    Text("31 \(Image(systemName: "star"))")
                        .foregroundColor(.red)
                        .font(.headline)
                )
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we use the *badge* view modifier with an instance of the *Text* view. It allows us to use *Text* view's modifiers to tune the badge's look and feel the way we need. We even can use interpolation to inject the image into the *Text* view.

#### Conclusion
This week, we learned how to use the new *badge* view modifier, a small feature of SwiftUI Release 3 that allows us to badge views effortlessly. I hope you enjoy the post.
