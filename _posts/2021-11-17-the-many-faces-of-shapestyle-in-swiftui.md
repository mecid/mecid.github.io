*ShapeStyle* is the protocol that we have from the very first release of the SwiftUI framework. *ShapeStyle* defines a color or pattern to use when rendering a shape. This week we will learn the many faces of *ShapeStyle* protocol and different implementations provided by the SwiftUI framework.

#### Colors
Usually, we don't use the *ShapeStyle* protocol itself. We use the many implementations of the protocol that SwiftUI provides us. One of them is the *Color* struct. We can use an instance of the *Color* struct to fill or stroke a shape in SwiftUI. Let's take a look at the quick example.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(Color.yellow)
            Circle()
                .stroke(Color.green, lineWidth: 16)
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

We can also use a *ShapeStyle* as a background or overlay for any view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Text("Hello, World!")
                .background(Color.red)
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
``` 

#### Gradients
Another implementation of the *ShapeStyle* protocol is gradients. You can use gradients anywhere in SwiftUI to provide an instance of the *ShapeStyle* protocol.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(
                    LinearGradient(
                        colors: [.green, .yellow],
                        startPoint: .top,
                        endPoint: .bottom
                    )
                )
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Hierarchical
SwiftUI provides us a shape style that maps to one of the numbered content styles. It has a few static instances: *primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary*. You can use one of them whenever you need to use the hierarchical styling of the content.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(.quaternary)
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Selection
There is a special implementation of the *ShapeStyle* protocol called *SelectionShapeStyle* that defines the platform-oriented selection styling.
You can use it whenever you need to highlight the selected state of the view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(SelectionShapeStyle())
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Tint
*TintShapeStyle* is another implementation of the *ShapeStyle* protocol that uses the tint color. SwiftUI uses the app's accent color by default, but you can override it using the *tint* view modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(TintShapeStyle())
        }
        .tint(Color.yellow)
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Background
*BackgroundStyle* type is the implementation of the *ShapeStyle* protocol that defines the background style in the current context. You can use it to adapt both dark and light themes.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(BackgroundStyle())
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Foreground
*ForegroundStyle* type is similar to the *BackgroundStyle* type but instead defines the foreground style of the current context. This one also works both in dark and light themes.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(ForegroundStyle())
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### Material
Materials in SwiftUI conform to the *ShapeStyle* protocol also. It means you can use provided materials as the instance of *ShapeStyle* protocol anywhere in SwiftUI.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(Material.ultraThin)
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### ImagePaint
*ImagePaint* type implements the *ShapeStyle* protocol and fills a shape by repeating a region of an image.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(ImagePaint(image: Image(systemName: "star")))
        }
        .padding(32)
    }
}
```

#### AnyShapeStyle
The last but not least type that conforms to the *ShapeStyle* protocol is the *AnyShapeStyle* type. *AnyShapeStyle* is the type-erased implementation of the *ShapeStyle* protocol that allows us to pass styles without using generics.

```swift
struct AvatarView: View {
    let style: AnyShapeStyle

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(style)
    }
}

let style = AnyShapeStyle(TintShapeStyle())
let avatarView = AvatarView(style: style)
```
