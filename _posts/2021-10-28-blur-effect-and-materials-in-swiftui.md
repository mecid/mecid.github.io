SwiftUI has the *blur* view modifier from the very first day. It allows us to build super custom blur effects quickly. On the other hand, SwiftUI Release 3 gives us the new *Material* type that specifies different blur effects defined in Human Interface Guidelines. This week we will learn how to use the *blur* view modifier and the new *Material* type to build translucent effects.

#### Basics
Let's start with learning how to use the *blur* view modifier in SwiftUI. All you need to do is to apply the view modifier to any view you want to blur.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.red, .yellow],
                startPoint: .top,
                endPoint: .bottom
            ).ignoresSafeArea()

            Text("Hello")
                .padding()
                .background {
                    Color.black
                        .blur(radius: 8, opaque: false)
                }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we create a *Text view with a black background. Next, we add the *blur* view modifier to apply a gaussian blur effect to the rendering of this view. The *blur* view modifier has two parameters that allow us to customize the produced result. The first one is the *radius* that defines the radial size of the blur effect. The second one is the *bool* value that specifies whether the renderer allows transparency. By default, it is *false*.

#### Materials
Apple provides us with a collection of materials. Material is ready to use translucent blur effect. You can use it to achieve a feeling of depth. Materials allow you to blur the background without changing the foreground content.

 SwiftUI has a set of standard materials that allow you to make your views look magnificent in any context. These effects automatically support both the light and dark modes. Let's take a look at how we can use them.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.red, .yellow],
                startPoint: .top,
                endPoint: .bottom
            ).ignoresSafeArea()

            Text("Hello")
                .padding()
                .background(
                    .regularMaterial,
                    in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8, style: .continuous)
                )
        }
    }
}
```

![regular-material](/public/blur1.png)

As you can see in the example, we use the *background* view modifier with regular material. Material isn't a view, but attaching material is similar to inserting a translucent layer between the view and its background. The blurring effect produced by the material isn't simple transparency. It uses an environment-defined mixing that produces a result that matches glass.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.red, .yellow],
                startPoint: .top,
                endPoint: .bottom
            ).ignoresSafeArea()

            Text("Hello")
                .padding()
                .background(
                    .ultraThickMaterial,
                    in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8, style: .continuous)
                )
        }
    }
}
```

![ultra-thick-material](/public/blur2.png)

SwiftUI has a set of materials with different thicknesses. Thicker materials have better contrast for text and other views.
* regular material
* thin material
* ultra-thin material
* thick material
* ultra-thick material

Remember that a material blurs the app's background, but not the content behind the app on the screen. For example, the content on the Home Screen doesn't affect the appearance of a widget.

#### Conclusion
This week we learned how to use the blur effect and system-provided materials defined in Human Interface Guidelines. Now you can go back and make your apps more vibrant by using new materials available in SwiftUI Release 3. I hope you enjoy the post.
