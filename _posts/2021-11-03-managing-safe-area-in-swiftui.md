A safe area defines the area within a view that isn't covered by a navigation bar, tab bar, toolbar, or other views. SwiftUI views respect safe areas out of the box. But there are plenty of situations when you need to customize this behavior. This week we will learn how to manage the safe area in SwiftUI.

#### Basics
Safe areas help us to keep our views inside the visible parts of the screen. For example, we can easily place our views between the navigation bar and home indicator using a safe area.

By default, SwiftUI place views only inside the safe area. Here is the example showing that.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                LinearGradient(
                    colors: [.red, .yellow],
                    startPoint: .topLeading,
                    endPoint: .bottomTrailing
                )
                .navigationTitle("Hello World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

But we can change this behavior using the *ignoresSafeArea* view modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                LinearGradient(
                    colors: [.red, .yellow],
                    startPoint: .topLeading,
                    endPoint: .bottomTrailing
                )
                .ignoresSafeArea()
                .navigationTitle("Hello World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The *ignoresSafeArea* view modifier expands the view and fills the space by ignoring the safe area. The *ignoresSafeArea* view modifier has two parameters that allow us to set the direction and the region of the ignored safe area.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                LinearGradient(
                    colors: [.red, .yellow],
                    startPoint: .topLeading,
                    endPoint: .bottomTrailing
                )
                .ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard, edges: .bottom)
                .ignoresSafeArea(.container, edges: [.top, .horizontal])
                .navigationTitle("Hello World")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Let's take a deep look at the possible parameters of the *ignoresSafeArea* view modifier.
1. The *regions* parameter allows us to set the ignored safe area type. For example, it might be a parent container, keyboard, or all of them.
2. The *edges* parameter allows us to ignore the safe area in the following direction or set of directions. For example, it could be *top, leading, bottom, trailing, horizontal, vertical, all*, or any combination of previous options.

#### safeAreaPadding view modifier
SwiftUI introduces the *safeAreaPadding* allowing us to shift the safe area for particular amount of space on the specified edge.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.red, .yellow],
                startPoint: .topLeading,
                endPoint: .bottomTrailing
            )
            .safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, 100)
            .navigationTitle("Hello World")
        }
    }
}
```

#### safeAreaInset view modifier
The *safeAreaInset* view modifier is another way to manage the safe area of the view. The *safeAreaInset* view modifier allows you to shift the safe area of the view by placing another view inside the original safe area of the view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.red, .yellow],
                startPoint: .topLeading,
                endPoint: .bottomTrailing
            )
            .ignoresSafeArea()
            .navigationTitle("Hello World")
            .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom, alignment: .center, spacing: 0) {
                Color.clear
                    .frame(height: 20)
                    .background(Material.bar)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, the *safeAreaInset* view modifier has a bunch of parameters that allow us to control the spacing, alignment, and edge of the shifted safe area. It also uses the *@ViewBuilder* closure to build the content of view that SwiftUI places in the space of the shifted safe area.

1. *edge* parameter allows you to set the vertical or horizontal edge of the shifted safe area region.
2. *spacing* parameter allows you to put some space between the shifted safe area and the view itself.
3. *alignment* parameter applies the horizontal or vertical alignment.
4. *content* is the *@ViewBuilder* closure that defines the content of the shifted safe area.

#### Conclusion
Today we learned how to manage the safe area in SwiftUI. Usually, we don't need it because SwiftUI handles it automatically. But feel free to customize the look and feel of your content with an immersive experience using safe area view modifiers. I hope you enjoy the post.
