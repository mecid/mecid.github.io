SwiftUI introduced a set of view modifiers, allowing us to manage the safe area in our views efficiently. In many cases, the safe area is where you want to put your content. Today, we will learn about the new content margin concept that SwiftUI introduced and how it differs from the safe area.

Let's start with a simple example demonstrating the list with a hundred items.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                    Text("Item \(index)")
                }
            }
            .font(.title)
            .navigationTitle("Item list")
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we place the *List* view with a bunch of *Text* views inside. It might look great on an iPhone, but it seems very strange on an iPad, as it places all the text on the leading edge and keeps the center of the screen empty.

While using UIKit, we have access to the *readableContentGuide* layout guide. Literally, it is another safe area that adapts to the screen size, but only for your text content. Unfortunately, we don't have access to *readableContentGuide* in SwiftUI.

We can workaround the issue by increasing the safe area on the iPad like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var sizeClass
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                    Text("Item \(index)")
                }
            }
            .font(.title)
            .navigationTitle("Item list")
            .safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, sizeClass == .regular ? 200 : 0)
        }
    }
}
```

We were able to shift the content to the center on the iPad by using the *horizontalSizeClass* environment value and the *safeAreaPadding* view modifier. However, as you can see, this also shifts the scrollbar indicator from the trailing edge to the center.

We need a way to differentiate the content and toolbars of the view and shift only the content while keeping the toolbars in the same place. Fortunately, SwiftUI introduces the new *contentMargins* view modifier, allowing us to shift a particular type of content in the view.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) private var sizeClass
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                    Text("Item \(index)")
                }
            }
            .font(.title)
            .navigationTitle("Item list")
            .contentMargins(
                .horizontal,
                sizeClass == .regular ? 200 : 0,
                for: .scrollContent
            )
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we use the *contentMargins* view modifier to shift only scrollable content away from the safe area. But it keeps the scrollbar on the trailing edge of the view.

The *contentMargins* view modifierÂ accepts a few parameters, allowing us to tune its behavior. The first parameter is the edge we want to shift. It might be *leading*, *trailing*, *top*, *horizontal*, *vertical*, or *all* at once. The second parameter is the amount of space we want to shift. The third parameter is an instance of the *ContentMarginPlacement* type, which allows us to specify the place we want to shift. For example, it might be the *scrollContent* as we do in our example. Another option is *scrollIndicators*, which only shifts the indicator.

Today, we learned about the new *contentMargins* view modifier. It is a crucial piece of the safe area management that was missing before in SwiftUI. Finally, we have a way to manage it and make our apps even more accessible and adaptable for different sizes of screens. I hope you enjoy the post.
