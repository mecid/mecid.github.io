This week we will continue mastering SwiftUI components by learning *Toggle*. *Toggle* is a view that we can use to allow users to toggle any boolean state in the app. SwiftUI enables us to customize toggles in a very convenient way by providing *ToggleStyle* protocol.

#### Basics
Let's start with the basics of the *Toggle* component. To use *Toggle*, we need to create it by providing a binding to a boolean value that it is going to toggle and a label view that can be any combination of views. Let's take a look at the very quick example of using a toggle.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var status = true

    var body: some View {
        Toggle(isOn: $status) {
            Text("toggle")
        }
    }
}
```

> *Binding* is a property wrapper that allows us to access value types in a reference like manner. To learn more about binding and other property wrappers provided by SwiftUI, take a look at my ["Understanding Property Wrappers in SwiftUI"](/2019/06/12/understanding-property-wrappers-in-swiftui/) post.

By default, SwiftUI uses the *UISwitch* view from *UIKit* to represent a *Toggle*. There is no way to change the tint color of *Toggle* from SwiftUI, but we can use *UIAppearance API* from *UIKit* to set the tint color for all *UISwitch* instances across the app. You can paste this line in *AppDelegate* to configure the color before you create a view.

```swift
UISwitch.appearance().onTintColor = .orange
```

Another thing which I want to mention is that you can easily hide the label of your *Toggle* by using a *labelsHidden* modifier.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var status = true

    var body: some View {
        Toggle(isOn: $status) {
            Text("toggle")
        }.labelsHidden()
    }
}
```
#### Toggle collection
The SwiftUI framework allows us to create a *Toggle* that binds to a collection of values. In the example below, we define a *Toggle* that uses keypath to boolean on the array of tasks. 

```swift
struct Task: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    var done = false
    var title = ""
}
    
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tasks: [Task] = [
        .init(title: "Task 1"),
        .init(title: "Task 2"),
    ]
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach($tasks, id: \.id) { $task in
                Toggle(isOn: $task.done) {
                    Text(verbatim: task.title)
                }
            }
            
            Toggle(sources: $tasks, isOn: \.done) {
                Text("Mark all")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Styling
We learned how to change the tint color of *Toggle*, but what about real styling options. For example, you might want to replace the *UISwitch* presentation of toggles with a checkbox. SwiftUI provides a *ToggleStyle* protocol that allows us to customize toggles in a way we can imagine. 

```swift
@available(iOS 13.0, OSX 10.15, tvOS 13.0, watchOS 6.0, *)
public protocol ToggleStyle {
    associatedtype Body : View

    func makeBody(configuration: Self.Configuration) -> Self.Body

    typealias Configuration = ToggleStyleConfiguration
}
```

> It is so awesome that SwiftUI allows us to style views in a consistent way. SwiftUI also provides *ButtonStyle* protocol that we can use to design buttons. To learn more, take a look at my ["Mastering buttons in SwiftUI"](/2020/02/19/mastering-buttons-in-swiftui/) post.

The only requirement of *ToggleStyle* protocol is *makeBody* function that should return some view. *makeBody* function has a single parameter that we can use to access a user-defined label to place it according to our design and binding that we can toggle when the user alters the state.
Let's create our very first *Toggle* style that will render it as a checkbox.

```swift
struct CheckboxToggleStyle: ToggleStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        return HStack {
            configuration.label
            Spacer()
            Image(systemName: configuration.isOn ? "checkmark.square" : "square")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 22, height: 22)
                .onTapGesture { configuration.isOn.toggle() }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we create a *CheckboxToggleStyle* struct that conforms *ToggleStyle* protocol. We place a user-defined label in an *HStack* with the *Image* that uses *SF Symbols* to display checkmark in a square whenever binding is true or an empty square when binding is false.

We can easily apply our *CheckboxToggleStyle* to every *Toggle* in our app by using the *toggleStyle* modifier. It uses the environment feature of SwiftUI to share the style with all views in the current environment. But remember that you can easily use this modifier on the concrete *Toggle* instance also.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var status = true

    var body: some View {
        Toggle(isOn: $status) {
            Text("toggle")
        }.toggleStyle(CheckboxToggleStyle())
    }
}
```

> SwiftUI uses environment to pass system-wide and application-related information. You can also populate environment with your custom objects. To learn more about environment, take a look at my ["The power of Environment in SwiftUI"](/2019/08/21/the-power-of-environment-in-swiftui/) post.

#### Conclusion
Today we learned about another vital SwiftUI component. I'm delighted that SwiftUI provides a very consistent way of styling views. I hope you enjoy the post.
