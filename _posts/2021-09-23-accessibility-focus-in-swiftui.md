One of the new features of SwiftUI Release 3 is accessibility focus management. SwiftUI allows us easily handle the focus state for assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Switch Control. This week we will learn how to use the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper to move the accessibility focus in SwiftUI.

SwiftUI Release 3 provides us a particular set of tools for managing accessibility focus. It includes the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper and the *accessibilityFocused* view modifier. We can handle accessibility focus in a similar way that we manage it without assistive technologies.

> To learn more about focus management in SwiftUI, take a look at my ["Mastering FocusState property wrapper in SwiftUI"](/2021/08/24/mastering-focusstate-property-wrapper-in-swiftui/) post.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct SignInView: View {
    @AccessibilityFocusState
    private var isEmailFocused: Bool

    @State private var email = ""

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                TextField("email", text: $email, prompt: Text("email"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($isEmailFocused)
            }
            .navigationTitle("Sign in")
            .onChange(of: isEmailFocused) { newValue in
                print(newValue)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we use the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper to define a variable that represents whenever the email field is focused. SwiftUI initializes the variable with the false value by default because the user can focus on any other area of the screen. We also use the *accessibilityFocused* view modifier to bind the focus state of a particular view to a variable holding its value. 

Remember that you can declare as many variables as you need to cover your accessibility focus logic with the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct SignInView: View {
    @AccessibilityFocusState
    private var isEmailFocused: Bool
    
    @AccessibilityFocusState
    private var isPasswordFocused: Bool

    @State private var email = ""
    @State private var password = ""

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                TextField("email", text: $email, prompt: Text("email"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($isEmailFocused)
                SecureField("password", text: $password, prompt: Text("password"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($isPasswordFocused)
            }
            .navigationTitle("Sign in")
        }
    }
}
```

The nice thing about the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper is that you can limit its behavior to a dedicated assistive technology. For example, you can activate the *AccessibilityFocusState* property wrapper only for VoiceOver or Switch Control. By default, SwiftUI aggregates the value for all assistive technologies available on the device.     

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct SignInView: View {
    @AccessibilityFocusState(for: .switchControl)
    private var isEmailFocused: Bool

    @State private var email = ""

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                TextField("email", text: $email, prompt: Text("email"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($isEmailFocused)
            }
            .navigationTitle("Sign in")
            .onChange(of: isEmailFocused) { newValue in
                print(newValue)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Usually, you have more than one element on the screen, and you might want to move the focus between them. For this particular case, SwiftUI provides us a way to define our focusable fields via enum and switch between them.

```swift
enum FocusableField: Hashable {
    case email
    case password
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var email = ""
    @State private var password = ""
    
    @AccessibilityFocusState
    private var focus: FocusableField?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                TextField("email", text: $email, prompt: Text("email"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($focus, equals: .email)
                SecureField("password", text: $password, prompt: Text("password"))
                    .accessibilityFocused($focus, equals: .password)
                Button("login", action: login)
            }
            .toolbar {
                ToolbarItem(placement: .keyboard) {
                    Button("next") {
                        if email.isEmpty {
                            focus = .email
                        } else if password.isEmpty {
                            focus = .password
                        } else {
                            focus = nil
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Sign in")
            .onAppear {
                DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
                    focus = .email
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private func login() {
        // your logic here
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use the *AccessibilityFocusState* view modifier with our new *FocusableField* enum that defines all the focusable views on the screen. Keep in mind that you should make the *FocusableField* enum hashable and define an optional variable with the help of the *AccessibilityFocusState* view modifier to allow the framework to set the value to **nil** whenever the user moves the focus from the views you define. 

We should also use another version of the *accessibilityFocused* view modifier to bind a view to a particular case of the hashable enum. Remember that you can programmatically move the focus of VoiceOver or Switch Control by changing the value of the variable wrapped with *AccessibilityFocusState*.

I love SwiftUI because the different APIs use the same style and they are consistent across various features. You can learn it once and apply it in multiple places. This week we learned how to manage the accessibility focus which is very similar to the first responder management. I hope you enjoy the post.
