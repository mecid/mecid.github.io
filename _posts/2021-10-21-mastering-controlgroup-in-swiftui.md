One of the new container views delivered in SwiftUI Release 3 was the *ControlGroup* view. The *ControlGroup* view displays semantically-related controls in a visually appropriate manner for the context. This week we will learn how to use and customize the appearance of the *ControlGroup* view in SwiftUI.

{% include friends.html %}

#### Basics
The *ControlGroup* view is the simple container view that accepts *ViewBuilder* closure and displays it depending on the current environment. Let's see how we can use it.

> To learn more about *ViewBuilder*, take a look at my dedicated ["The power of @ViewBuilder in SwiftUI"](/2019/12/18/the-power-of-viewbuilder-in-swiftui/) post.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ControlGroup {
            Button(action: {}) {
                Label("Decrease", systemImage: "minus")
            }

            Button(action: {}) {
                Label("Increase", systemImage: "plus")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we simply put two buttons inside the *ControlGroup* view as we do with *VStack* or *HStack*. But instead of laying out views using vertical or horizontal axes, the *ControlGroup* adds the semantic look and feel depending on the view's placement.

#### Styling
The *ControlGroup* view has a few styling options out of the box. SwiftUI provides *automatic* and *navigation* styles. The *automatic* style is used by default, but you can set another style directly using the *controlGroupStyle* view modifier. SwiftUI uses the *navigation* style when you place the *ControlGroup* view in the toolbar of the *NavigationView*.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ControlGroup {
            Button(action: {}) {
                Label("Decrease", systemImage: "minus")
            }

            Button(action: {}) {
                Label("Increase", systemImage: "plus")
            }
        }
        .controlGroupStyle(.navigation)
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example, we use the *controlGroupStyle* view modifier to set the style manually. SwiftUI uses the same approach for many different views and allows us to create our own style types by conforming to a protocol. In the case of the *ControlGroup* view, we should create a type that conforms to the *ControlGroupStyle* protocol and implement the single required function called *makeBody*. 

> To learn more about other styling protocols available in SwiftUI, take a look at ["Mastering buttons in SwiftUI"](/2020/02/19/mastering-buttons-in-swiftui/) post.

```swift
struct VerticalControlGroupStyle: ControlGroupStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        VStack {
            configuration.content
        }.foregroundColor(.red)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ControlGroup {
            Button("Action 1") {}
            Button("Action 2") {}
        }
        .controlGroupStyle(VerticalControlGroupStyle())
    }
}
```

The *makeBody* function has the single parameter of *Configuration* type that you can use to access the content of the *ControlGroup* passed via *ViewBuilder* closure. It allows you to modify the look and feel of the content in the way you need by applying any view modifiers you want. In the current example, we place the content in the vertical stack and set the foreground color to red.

```swift
struct ControlGroupWithTitle: ControlGroupStyle {
    let title: LocalizedStringKey

    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        VStack {
            Text(title)
                .font(.title)
            HStack {
                configuration.content
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ControlGroup {
            Button("Action 1") {}
            Button("Action 2") {}
        }
        .controlGroupStyle(ControlGroupWithTitle(title: "Actions"))
    }
}
```

We also can change the look and feel by adding new views and wrapping the content with another container view.

```swift
extension ControlGroupStyle where Self == ControlGroupWithTitle {
    static func with(title: LocalizedStringKey) -> ControlGroupWithTitle {
        ControlGroupWithTitle(title: title)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ControlGroup {
            Button("Action 1") {}
            Button("Action 2") {}
        }.controlGroupStyle(.with(title: "Actions"))
    }
}
```

Swift 5.5 allows us to write extensions for protocols with associated types and improve the usage of our custom styles provided to the *controlGroupStyle* view modifier.

#### Conclusion
The *ControlGroup* view is a new way to group buttons and other controls in a semantic way. I really love SwiftUI because it uses the same approach across the many views to provide custom styling options. I hope you enjoy the post.
