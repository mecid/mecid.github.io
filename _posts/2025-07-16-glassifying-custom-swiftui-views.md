title: Glassifying custom SwiftUI views

We already talked about glassifying tabs and toolbars in SwiftUI. This week, we will continue the topic of the new Liquid Glass design language and will talk about applying this concept to custom views.

The SwiftUI framework introduced the glassEffect view modifier. We can apply it to any view to enable glass effect. You should keep in mind that glass effect is not a simple background. It interacts with the views behind it and changes its properties. Even more, it can change the color scheme of your view from light to dark depending on the content behind it.

```swift
```

As you can see in the example above, we simply add the glassEffect view modifier. Thatâ€™s it. It takes care of your view and makes it glassy. The SwiftUI framework provides us with a few options while using the glassEffect view modifier.

There are three options at the moment: regular, clear, and identity. These are the predefined instances of the Glass type. Identity is great whenever you need to conditionally turn off the glass effect.

```swift
```

The regular one is the most used across the system. There is also the clear option, which gives you more transparency. All of these glass types can be modified using the tint function.

```swift
```

The tint function blends into the glass the color you provide. There is also the interactive function on the Glass type, allowing us to make any of the provided styles more interactive. By default, all of them reflect the views behind, but whenever you apply the interactive function, it makes them even more aggressive to the content behind.

```swift
```

The second parameter on the glassEffect view modifier is the shape of the glass. By default, it uses the instance of the DefaultGlassEffectShape. But you can modify it using any shape you need.

```swift
```
